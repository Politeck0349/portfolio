      "I can’t thank you enough for this life changing opportunity you have given my son Bobby.  ️\n",
      "As a Korean-American myself… I was actually never proud of my Korean side because of all the mono-culture and politics… but this. This series has ignited a little bit of pride knowing that some open minded younger generation kids with great palettes are showing so much love for the food and that I should be grateful for my parents and how much they’ve given me easily the experiences these boys are just going through now. \n",
      "What an amazing opportunity and gift to give these wonderful young men! It will certainly help shape their lives, and give them so many experiences and memories.  These boys are just fabulous, so kind and polite.  Can't wait to see the videos!!!\n",
      "I am a professor in Latin america...and I can't be happier and proud of you (Korean Englishman and JOLLY) as they will give these guys an experience they will never forget in their lives, because it's not always easy to know other cultures, and you give them a great opportunity, as a teacher, i thank you.<3\n",

      "Bobby's reaction to the reveal that they're Korean bound was priceless & timely reminder for me to never take opportunities to travel overseas for granted - to savour every moment!\n",

      "What an amazing thing you’ve done here Josh and Olly. I believe this will be something these guys will remember all of their life. It’s been so much fun seeing them experience Korean food with you guys, I’m pretty excited to see them experience Korea. \n",
      "these kids are hilarious. And its not even them trying to be funny, its just their wholesomeness of being a kid. Ah hope these lads enjoyed themselves! Such a great graduation trip! So funny when Bobby started connecting the dots that his mum knew, “big things ahead”\n",
      "Their reactions are adorable, pure happiness and excitement. But my fav is Max who is over the top with joy he even lifts Armand :3\n",
      "“I’m bringing two suitcases , one going be empty just for ssamjang” LMAO I love these kids they’re so hilarious \n",

      "some ppl said they teared up- and i didn’t think i would.. but i did as well ; the opportunity you have given to these boys is insane and so heartwarming. the last big school trip i did to the east coast with my classmates is an experience i will never forget. they for sure will never forget this <3\n",
      "Crying and so happy for them. And for the 2 men who started all this, you guys rock.\n",
      "이런 규모 있는 프로젝트를 진행하면서 자연스럽게 한국을 소개함과 동시에 영어권 국가와 문화적 교류를 진행하면서 양쪽 모두에게 긍정적인 경험을 체험하게 만들어주는 채널. 너무 좋아요…. 저 학생들뿐만 아니라 이 영상을 보는 모든 시청자가 그 경험을 공유하면서 양 국가 모두에 긍정적인 인식을 확장해 나가는 것, 이게 바로 유튜브의 긍정적인 효과가 아닌가 싶습니다. 자극적인 내용을 내세우는 다른 몇몇 채널과는 다르게 꾸준히 정성을 들인 콘텐츠를 만들어내는 영국남자 안의 모든 크리에이터분들 존경합니다!\n",
      "I can't imagine how hard the logistics and the preparation Josh and Ollie's team went through to prepare for this awesome trip. From the communication with the parents, the build up, to the itinerary and actually taking care of the boys in Korea. These guys have my total respect giving these highschool kids with a good head and heart in them a trip of a lifetime. A person rarely gets to experience a school trip/graduation gift of this magnitude in their lives.\n",
      "Not going to lie this made my month just seeing it now and the my mum knew and kept saying big things ahead made be sobbing with joy 10/10 love it \n",
      "Coming back and watching this after their trip and journey in Korea and learning everything they learned is just so darn wholesome. I'm so happy these boys got to experience this. Thank you Josh, Olly and all involved in making this and sharing with us all!\n",
      "“이번 여행을 통해 왜 제가 한국을 사랑할수 밖에 없는지 알게 될거에요” \n",

      "조쉬의 멘트처럼 내가 좋아하는것들을 보여주고 경험하고 그들이 공감하는 모습을 볼때 말로 다 할수 없는 희열을 느끼죠\n",
      "I absolutely love the connection these kids have with each other. Something dearly missed in A LOT of American schools these days.\n",
      "How Max's reaction pure is! He expressed his happiness as just a kid when he opened a big present. So cute and adorable.\n",
      "와 미쳤다…\n",
      "Already TOO EXCITED FOR THIS OMG\n",
      "The lads have come a very long way since their very first meal with Josh and Ollie. Watching them enjoy the food and culture, being more confident using the korean language and just being young men on an adventure is inspiring. I am even more determined now to learn korean myself and to one day experience all that Korea has to offer irl. Thank you Korean Englishman & Jolly for sharing the love.\n",
      "One of the best and my most favorite series on youtube EVER! Josh and Ollie together with the Korean Englishmen staff are so caring and wonderful for giving the boys the most amazing experience of their lives, I've watched this for like 3 times now and now I'm also tuning in to Armand and Max's new segment on this channel as well <3333\n",
      "Not Bobby’s mom tracking this flight! I LOVE IT \n",
      "I don't know why, but it's a joy seeing these kids embrace and appreciate one's culture. And why did I feel emotional watching this, as someone who have seen their food reviews from the very beginning because I myself is interested in learning more about Korean's food and culture. Enjoy the trip!\n",
      "whenever im sad, i come back to this video and i leave smiling. they really didn't know how much fun they're going to have in this trip\n",
      "I know for a fact it’s not just me or 10 people who patiently waited for this. I just wanna say, thank you Josh, Ollie, and the whole Korean Englishman team for making it happen for the boys and for us viewers! Ahhh, can’t wait!\n",
      "애들 반응 다 너무 귀엽고 내가 다 기쁘다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 보비 너무 귀여워ㅠㅜㅜㅠㅠ\n",
      "Really love this series!!! Thank you so much for the great content!\n",
      "Coming back to this after a few months of watching videos from the high schoolers in Korea series and this is making me emotional. You couldn't have picked a more genuine and thankful group of young men to take on this trip. This is some of the most heartwarming content on YouTube these days \n",
      "와 부모님들 입장에서는 무료로 자기 자식들 최고급으로 여행시켜줬으니 완전 좋겠다\n",
      "I’m addicted to these guys story of experiencing Korean culture :) so fun to watch. All the boys have great characters and reaction :)\n",
      "OMGGGGG THIS IS SO EXCITING. THEY GONNA REMEMBER THE MEMORIES AND TALK ABOUT IT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. YOU JOSH AND OLLIE REALLY MADE THEIR DREAM COMETRUE AND THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. I WISH THEIR SERIES WILL GET A MASSIVE VIEWS AND LIKES.\n",
      "Rewatching the whole series!\n",
      "Definitely the best series so far on this channel.\n",
      "Each boys have their own character and amazing personality.\n",
      "I love their interactions!\n",
      "As a Mom, this is just the coolest trip ever for the boys!  I think next year….IT needs to be the Girls turn.  Of course with proper chaperone’s but letting the girls experience the taste & beauty of Korea.   Just a suggestion!   But, I have really enjoyed watching these young men being so grateful for such an amazing experience!   \n",
      "Totally can say that I am jealous!  🇺🇸\n",
      "You guys are amazing for giving these kids a one in a lifetime experience like this to experience South Korea in its full glory. It's definitely on my bucket list of countries to visit just because of you guys. Would've loved to see Malachi & Jeremiah on this trip as well but I'm sure there's a reason you didn't go with them.\n",
      "That made me so happy to watch.  What good and grateful boys too. No spoiled brats here.  I loved this episode.\n",
      "i'm jealous but at the same time so happy and excited for this wonderful experience to unfold! what we've only imagined before has finally happened – seeing the boys in Korea, experiencing all of the Korean culture in person! \n",
      "\n",
      "this series has been an enjoyable and unforgettable one, unlike any documentary i've seen before. thank you Korean Englishman and to the highschoolers of Fulham! love lots! \n",
      "Ollie's singing \"The high schoolers are coming to Korea... Finally.\" was the highlight.\n",
      "Just found this and binged the entire series and this culmination is absolutely next level amazing. This made my day\n",
      "I've just finished watching the episode with the teachers & head master after they return from Korea. This has been such an incredible journey in which I as an observer have learned so much. My appreciation for Korea, Josh & Ollie & the Fulham Boys has grown immensely. So I decided to go back to this episode to where they 1st found out they were going to Korea. The boys joy & enthusiasm has never wavered throughout. And to see them continue on sharing korean food & culture is heartwarming. Beautiful \n",
      "Feel like I've gained a whole flock of nephews, watching these young men through all their videos with Ollie and Josh. Love them all at this point and pray their lives continue to be blessed!\n",
      "So many comments saying what a lovely and unique opportunity- well wouldn't it be wonderful if this kind of gift became more commonplace? Hoping those with the means would be inspired to do their own versions. \n",
      "Everytime I see this video I tear up a lil. Seeing these young boys getting such an opportunity to explore the world, meet new people, and get to see other culture is so heart warming. Honestly, I feel like an elder sister smiling with tears in her eyes, seeing these lads go bonkers. A heartfelt thanks to Josh, Ollie and the entire team of Jolly for including these gents in this opportunity of a lifetime. Beautiful .\n",

I have no doubt that you will continue to be shining examples to millions of people on how to simply be a decent person.

So polite to everyone and their long friendships with each other is so evident.  They reflect well on their families and their school.  Makes me want to go back to Korea again!!\n",
      "This is fantastic! I almost teared up seeing these young men get so excited. I love Korea!\n",
      "I love that the kids are getting to do this but can I also just mention and note the fact that their headmaster (who has never been to Korea but has known Josh for a very long time) is also coming? How sweet is it that he's going to be experiencing Korea for the first time with his students and long time good friend? I love that this is happening. What a wonderful series and ride this has been.\n",
      "I am so glad I searched for \"British highschoolers try\"  after watching some similar videos on the other channel. I was  thinking, \"'this couldn't be all there is? Josh and Ollie are perfect mentors and these kids are hilarious and bright, there has got to be more\". \n",

      "My mum passed away in 2008, and everyday since then, there's at least one moment when I think of her. It's comforting to hear these young men speak of their parents so highly and with respect. E.g. \"I'll give my mum a hug when I see her\" or words to that effect. If only time travel were possible - I'd hug mum again and never let go!\n",
      "Maybe just maybe, you can bring Bobby and his mother to Korea. Seems to me she might deserve this too and watching her discover Korea together with her son might be very special to see.\n",
      "Your channel has done so much to break down cultural barrier across a continent that is vastly different in language, culture and landscape. Especially what you have done with these British schoolers.  Life education through experience is worth a million time better than sitting in a classroom learning a foreign language. So fascinating to observe the transformation of these young men, so fresh and open to embark a challenging life experience! Just love your channel! Hope you keep extending to other British schoolers.\n",

      "no matter how many times I watch this, Mr.Smith just slowly backing out at 2:31 will never be not funny \n",
      "Can I just give a shoutout to Harvey's parents? He always comes across as very humble, and very appreciative (eg shouting out thank you to Gabby for the toast, and then saying how he didn't know how he could pay them back for the Korean trip). This shows how well-mannered he is. All the boys are great, but he always sticks out for being the most respectful. Good on them.\n",
      "so heartwarming happy for you boys\n",
      "I am soo happyy for these guys!! Thanks to the team for giving them this wonderful experience!! I instantly become so happy when I see them all excited and enjoying everything they do. This series is soo great. To the whole team, YOU GUYS DID SOO WELL!\n",

      "I almost cried watching this...I am so happy these boys get to experience Korea to the fullest as a first trip. This series has been such a joy to watch and I know they're going to enjoy themselves to the fullest. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm especially happy for Armand since he's been dropping hints of wanting to go from the start lol and he actually has done research on the culture and food he's such an intelligent curious guy. He'll definitely learn so much on this trip\n",
      "After watching this beautiful moment a couple of times I suddenly recognized Ode To Joy in the background during the reveal, and it only seemed appropriate to post the lyrics here, as they fit so well with this lovely group of lads and the little slice of life they were fortunate enough to share with Josh, Ollie, their teachers and the crew.\n",
      "These boys will be famous! They are just so genuine\n",
      "This is so cute\n",
      "So happy for the boys! They deserve this!!\n",

This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime trip these boys are never going to forget and I’m so happy and so thankful we get to come along on this journey with them. I’m so incredibly excited for this series, next week can’t come fast enough!\n",
      "after hitting 30, now i understood why my friends' mum and dads were so kind and generous to me: like 17-18 year old kids are so cute and pure as they are it gives us eternal smiles :)\n",

      "Wow the reactions, the sneak peeks, the emotion, everything is just hitting me all at once. These next few videos coming out are going to be so crazy. Being a Korean-American and not being to travel to Korea often, it brings joy and tears to me to be able to see people who've never experienced Korea before, experience it in such a loving and exciting way. Brings me back to the times when I visited Korea as well for the first time and the raw emotions it elicited out of me. Hope you guys enjoy(ed) your time in Korea. 잘 다녀와요 ~\n",

      "As a 9th grader with only a couple years left but moving to a different country, the thing i will miss most about school, is how much fun you can actually have, even during the lessons, obviously you should pay attention to class, but every now and then you should have a little fun, mess around with your friends, because once you leave school, that wont be possible anymore, sure you could spend all day gaming with your friends, but you should go out and cherish the time with your friends, cuz trust me, 12 years of school sounds like a lot, but it feels like yesterday i was messing around with the coolest teacher in maths class. Have fun in school kids, enjoy it while it lasts\n",

They really did not see that coming. And I love love how they kept being humble all this time, this experience must have been the most unforgettable one in their adolescent life. What a way to say goodbye to highschool and say hello to the real world! I hope they'll keep finding joy and their future will be a bright as Armand's smile and as genuine as Bobby's love for his mom. Can't wait for the series to start!\n",

I’m starting to think everyone should have at least one trip out of their countries, just to broaden their minds and experiences of what is out there in the world. To think, one year ago these boys may not have tried Korean food had you not introduced it to them, either for lack of exposure to it or scared to try it, and now here you are taking them to Korea! You have opened a world to them they might not have had exposure to otherwise. I look forward to the series because I know it’ll be a good one.\n",
